# Data Migration

KoutenDB's internal WAL and snapshot files are implementation details before
v1.0. They are hardened for recovery, but they are not the recommended
cross-version interchange format.

Use JSON Lines dump/import as the portable migration boundary:

```bash
kouten dump --data=./source-db --out=./koutendb-dump.jsonl
kouten import-jsonl --data=./target-db --in=./koutendb-dump.jsonl
```

This path is intended for:

- cross-version migration while the internal WAL format can still evolve;
- human-readable inspection and audit exports;
- moving data between local environments;
- importing MongoDB-like or document-store JSONL exports with ring routing.

## KoutenDB Dump Format

`kouten dump` writes `koutendb.dump.v1` JSONL. The file contains:

| Line type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `meta` | Dump metadata such as format, galaxy, epoch, node count, document count, and ring count. |
| `ring` | Ring metadata such as key, name, period, and head angle. |
| `document` | A stored payload with ring, payload bytes as a JSON string, optional vector, and payload codec. |

Example document line:

```json
{"type":"document","ring":"docs/json","payload":"{\"title\":\"Hello\"}","codec":"json","vec":[1.0,0.0]}
```

`kouten import-jsonl` recognizes this dump shape. It skips `meta` and `ring`
lines, then imports `document` lines into their original ring with payload,
vector, and codec metadata preserved. KoutenDB IDs are reissued in the target
store; applications should not treat dump/import as an ID-preserving binary
clone.

## External JSONL Imports

For external document stores, provide routing fields:

```bash
kouten import-jsonl \
  --data=./target-db \
  --in=./mongo-export.jsonl \
  --ring-field=tenant \
  --ring-prefix=tenant/ \
  --payload-field=body \
  --vec-field=embedding
```

If `ring-field` is missing or empty for a row, KoutenDB uses `--default-ring`.
Blank rows are skipped. Malformed JSON rows are counted as errors without
stopping the whole import.

## Backup Is Different

Use backup/restore for operational recovery:

```bash
kouten backup --data=./source-db --backup=./backup
kouten restore --backup=./backup --data=./restored-db
```

Backup/restore preserves the internal store more directly and is meant for
same-version recovery. Dump/import is the safer public boundary when the goal is
portability, reviewability, or release-to-release migration.
