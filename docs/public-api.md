# Public API

This page summarizes the stable user-facing API surface for the current
technical preview. The canonical Nim definitions live in `src/koutendb.nim`.

## Core Types

| Type | Important fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KoutenDb` | opaque handle | Embedded or cluster database handle. |
| `KoutenId` | opaque; printable as `parent:seq` | ID returned by `put`; pass it to `get`, `query`, `locate`, `nextVisit`, and `nextJoin`. |
| `KoutenTx` | opaque transaction handle | Transaction context returned by `beginTransaction`. |
| `GalaxyRouter` | opaque router handle | Holds named galaxy connections for applications that access multiple galaxies. |
| `KoutenRecord` | `id`, `payload` | Lightweight record returned by `listByRing`. |
| `KoutenListPage` | `items`, `nextCursor` | Cursor-paginated list result. Empty `nextCursor` means there is no next page. |
| `KoutenReadOptions` | `filter`, `selection`, `limit`, `cursor`, `pagination`, `page`, `pageLimit`, `sortField`, `sortDirection` | Ring read options shared with CLI semantics. |
| `KoutenReadPage` | `ring`, `count`, `items`, `nextCursor`, `pagination`, `page`, `pageLimit`, `sortField`, `sortDirection` | Ring read result. `count` is the number of returned items; use `countByRing` for the total ring size. |
| `KoutenStellarOptions` | `filter`, `selection`, `limitPerRing`, `subringLimits`, `subringSortFields`, `subringSortDirections`, `maxDepth`, `branchBudget`, `subrings`, `includeRoot`, `sortField`, `sortDirection` | Coordinate-near read options. A root ring behaves like a telescope target; nearby rings are visible unless narrowed by `subrings`. `limitPerRing`, `sortField`, and `sortDirection` are defaults; the `subring*` tables override them for named subrings. |
| `KoutenStellarPage` | `root`, `ringsVisited`, `count`, `rings` | Grouped result for a stellar neighborhood read. |
| `KoutenLockToken` | `scope`, `coordinate`, `token`, `fence`, `expiresAt`, `keys` | Cooperative opt-in lock token for high-integrity embedded workflows. `fence` is a monotonically increasing handle-local fencing value. |
| `KoutenHit` | `id`, `score`, `payload` | Retrieval hit. `score` is cosine similarity, higher is closer. |

`KoutenId` should normally be treated as opaque. `toRaw` and `fromRaw` exist for
C ABI / driver boundaries and CLI reproducibility, not as the preferred
application model.

## Retrieval Types

| Type | Important fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `RetrieveStats` | `totalVectors`, `scanned`, `skippedVectors`, `returned`, `ringsTouched`, `payloadBytes`, `estimatedTokens`, `candidateReduction` | Explains how much work retrieval avoided or performed. |
| `RetrievalPlan` | `strategy`, `baseRing`, `amount`, `scope`, `depth`, `budget`, `focus`, `effectiveTopRings`, `selectedRings`, `prunedRings`, `reason` | Human-readable execution plan for retrieval tuning. |
| `RingMetric` | `ringKey`, `count`, `coherence` | Low-level ring population and coherence metric. |
| `KoutenRingSummary` | `ringKey`, `count`, `centroid`, `score`, `coherence`, `massG` | Ring summary used by atlas/planner-style workflows. |
| `RetrievalEnvelopeOptions` | `provider`, `galaxy`, `ring`, `requestId`, `sourceType`, `retentionClass`, `plan` | Metadata for RAG/MCP adapters. |

For application-facing tuning, prefer `SearchProfile` over raw numeric knobs:

| Type | Values | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ResultAmount` | `raFew`, `raNormal`, `raMany`, `raAllUseful` | How much useful context to keep. |
| `SearchScope` | `ssTight`, `ssNear`, `ssWide`, `ssAll` | How broadly to search related rings. |
| `SearchDepth` | `sdShallow`, `sdNormal`, `sdDeep`, `sdVeryDeep` | How far to descend ring hierarchy. |
| `SearchProfile` | `amount`, `scope`, `depth`, `note` | Named human-facing retrieval profile. |
| `RetrievalTuning` | `budget`, `focus`, `topRings`, `branchBudget`, `maxDepth`, `includeChildren` | Lower-level retrieval knobs. Use when you need explicit tuning. |
| `KoutenGuardrails` | `maxPayloadBytes`, `maxVectorDim`, `maxRingCount`, `maxRecordsPerRing` | Opt-in write-path limits for production trials. Zero means disabled. |

## Sync And Job Types

| Type | Important fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `UniverseSyncEvent` | `id`, `eventKey`, `sourceUniverse`, `sourceGalaxy`, `ring`, `logicalKey`, `payload`, `timestamp`, `acknowledged`, `error` | Durable eventual-convergence event in the source outbox. |
| `UniverseSyncStats` | `read`, `applied`, `skipped`, `acked`, `pruned`, `errors` | One-shot sync result. |
| `RingApplyPolicy` | `mode`, `historyKeep`, `delayMs` | Per-ring universe apply behavior. |
| `RingApplyMode` | `ramLatestOnly`, `ramAppendOnly`, `ramBoundedHistory`, `ramDelayedTimestamp` | How a ring treats replay, history, and delayed timestamp apply. |
| `WarpJob` | `id`, `rings`, `whereField`, `equals`, `patch`, `status`, `attempts`, `retryAt`, `acknowledged`, `error` | Delayed ring-scoped JSON patch job. |
| `WarpStepResult` | `job`, `scanned`, `matched`, `updated` | Result from one `warpStep`. |
| `WarpStatus` | `wsPending`, `wsRunning`, `wsDone`, `wsFailed`, `wsDeadLetter` | Warp job lifecycle. |

## Persistence Types

| Type | Important fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CompactStats` | store-defined | Result of WAL compaction. |
| `BackupStats` | store-defined | Result of backup / verify / restore operations. |
| `KoutenOperationalVerifyReport` | object | Data-dir operational verification report. |
| `KoutenOperationalCheck` | object | One named operational verification check. |

The C ABI exposes matching additive functions: `kouten_put_codec`,
`kouten_put_vec_codec`, and `kouten_get_codec`. See [Payload Codecs](payload-codecs.md).

## Ring Reads

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `listByRing(ring, limit = 100, cursor = "")` | List records in one ring with cursor pagination. |
| `readRing(ring, options = defaultReadOptions())` | Read one ring with filter, selection, cursor/page limit, and page-local sort. |
| `readStellar(root, options = defaultStellarOptions())` | Read the root ring and nearby coordinate rings. Parent, child, and sibling rings can be in the same field of view; distant rings are not forced into the read path. |
| `configureTimeOrbitProfile(ring, profile)` | Configure an embedded ring-local time orbit for log/event placement. The profile is persisted as ring metadata. |
| `timeOrbitProfile(ring)` | Read the effective time-orbit profile for a ring. |
| `putTime(payload/doc, ring, timestampMs)` | Store a log/event payload into the calculated time-bucket ring. JSON object payloads receive `eventTimeMs` and `ingestTimeMs` when missing. |
| `readTime(ring, fromMs, toMs, options)` | Calculate the affected time-bucket rings and read only those buckets, using normal read filters/projection inside each bucket. |
| `defaultReadOptions().withFilter(koutenFilter().eq(...))` | Apply a typed filter builder to ring reads. |

| `tunedRetrievalPlan(db, profile = "default", ...)` | Build a plan from a stored profile. |
| `searchPlan(...)` | Build a plan from human-facing amount/scope/depth terms. |

| `retrievalEnvelope(...)` | Return retrieval results with source metadata for RAG/MCP adapters. |

## Placement And Observability

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `locate(id, at = -1.0)` | Compute the owning node for an ID at the current or specified time. |
| `nextVisit(id, node)` | Compute when an ID next visits a node. |
| `nextJoin(a, b)` | Compute the next co-location time for two KoutenDB IDs. |

## Transactions

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|

| `tx.put(...)` | Stage a write. |
| `tx.update(...)` | Stage an update. |
| `tx.remove(id)` | Stage a delete. |
| `tx.commit()` | Commit. |
| `tx.rollback()` | Roll back. |
| `transaction(db, proc(tx))` | Helper that rolls back on exception. |

Cluster transactions are a PoC. They use a landing intent and retry apply, but
coordinator redundancy is still planned.

## Cooperative Locks

Coordinate locks are opt-in guards for high-integrity embedded workflows. Normal
`put`, `get`, `list`, and `retrieve` do not check these locks, so the lightweight
NoSQL path remains unchanged. Use locks around workflows that need explicit
coordination, idempotency, or rollback behavior.

| API | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `acquireRingLock(ring, ttlSeconds = 30.0, waitMs = 0)` | Acquire a cooperative lock for one ring coordinate. |
| `acquireStellarLock(stellar, ttlSeconds = 30.0, waitMs = 0)` | Acquire a cooperative lock for a stellar lens and its current member rings. |
| `releaseLock(token)` | Release a lock if the owner token still matches. |
| `withRingLock(ring, proc())` | Acquire/release a ring lock around a body. |
| `withStellarLock(stellar, proc())` | Acquire/release a stellar lock around a body. |

Each acquired lock gets a distinct token and an increasing `fence` value. A
later reacquire after TTL expiry cannot be accidentally released by an older
token.

These locks are not presented as a payment-ledger or financial-core mechanism.
They are intended for application workflows such as order state updates,
webhook processing, retry-safe maintenance, and coordinated edits around a ring
or stellar lens.

## Atlas And Descriptions

| `getGalaxyDescription()` | Read the galaxy description. |
| `setRingDescription(ring, description)` | Set a ring map description. |
| `getRingDescription(ring)` | Read a ring description. |
| `atlas()` | Return a galaxy/ring map for agents and tools. |

## Persistence And Data Movement

| `backup(dstDir)` | Create a compact backup. |
| `backupEncrypted(dstDir, passphrase)` | Create an encrypted backup. |
| `verifyBackup(backupDir)` | Verify a backup. |
| `operationalVerify(dataDir, diskBacked = true, verifySegments = false, maxWalBytes = -1, maxSegmentFiles = -1, maxItems = -1, maxRings = -1)` | Open and inspect a persistent embedded data directory, optionally failing when WAL bytes, segment-file count, item count, or ring count exceed configured trial thresholds. |
| `auditLogPath(dataDir)` / `auditLogPath(db)` | Return the append-only audit JSONL path for persistent embedded stores. |
| `restoreBackup(backupDir, dataDir, overwrite = false, durability = durBuffered)` | Restore into a data directory. |
