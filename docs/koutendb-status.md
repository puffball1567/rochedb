## Core DB

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Embedded DB | Done | `open(dataDir=...)` and memory-only mode |
| put / get | Done | Ring-scoped writes and ID-based reads |
| ORM foundation API | Done | Embedded APIs plus cluster PoC for `update`, JSON `patch`, `deleteById`, `listByRing`, `countByRing`; canonical data is expected to live in one galaxy/ring, with alternate views handled by ring hierarchy, naming, import rules, and retrieval profiles; driver exposure is still pending |
| Warp belt | PoC | WAL-backed delayed patch queue: `enqueueWarp`, `warpStep`, `warpDrain`; scans specified rings in registration order and drops merge patches onto matching JSON documents; includes minimal attempts / retryAt / maxAttempts / ack / dead-letter state plus acked-job cleanup; FlowBrigade and FlowLogbook adapters are planned instead of core dependencies; server scheduling is still pending |
| JSON document query | Done | GraphQL-style selection |
| Payload codecs | PoC | Per-record `raw` / `json` / `nif` / `bif` metadata survives WAL, cluster transport, handoff, transactions, Universe sync, and retrieval. NIF/BIF encoding/decoding remains outside the core; optional adapter: [`koutendb-nif`](https://github.com/puffball1567/koutendb-nif) backed by [`nifkit`](https://github.com/puffball1567/nifkit) |
| Prepared selection | Done | Reusable validated projection tree in embedded mode plus a bounded server-side parse cache for cluster queries |
| Vector retrieve | Done | FAISS bridge is the intended production vector path. Exact backend remains for small datasets, tests, and fallback |
| Ring / hierarchy | Done | `ring = "a/b/c"` and child-ring expansion |
| Galaxy isolation | Done | Separate data dir / peer list / credential boundary |
| Atlas / ring map | Done | `atlas()` and `kouten atlas` |
| Galaxy/ring description | Done | Atlas map annotations, not payload text |
| Time orbit | PoC | Embedded ring-local 60-bit millisecond orbit for log/event/time-series placement. Includes persisted profiles, `putTime` / `readTime`, and `kouten time-orbit/time-put/time-get`; cluster profile administration is still pending. Design note: [time-orbit.md](./time-orbit.md) |
| Retrieval tuning profile | Done | amount / scope / depth |
| FAISS vector backend | PoC | Dynamic bridge via `libkouten_faiss.so`; default fetch tag is FAISS `v1.14.3`, exact commit pinning is optional via `KOUTEN_FAISS_COMMIT`; `kouten doctor`, bridge build, `tests/tapi.nim`, and `examples/vector_backend_bench.sh` are verified locally |
| FAISS GPU backend | Not planned for core | KoutenDB is designed to reduce the search set before ANN/LLM work. Needing GPU FAISS is treated as a placement or retrieval-profile issue first |
| Retrieval planner | PoC | Deterministic heuristic planner. Stronger planner claims require larger real-corpus benchmarks and further tuning |
| WASM browser embedded | Post-v0.1 candidate | Browser state boundary / IndexedDB / OPFS |

## Persistence / Operations

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Append-only WAL | Done | Batched flush by default; `durStrong` / `--durability=strong` adds flush + fsync write boundaries. New WAL files use a magic/version header and per-record length + CRC32 wrappers; legacy pre-v1.0 WAL remains readable for migration |
| Reopen recovery | Done | Items / vectors / ring metadata / descriptions |
| Operational verify | Foundation | `operationalVerify(dataDir)` and `kouten verify --data=DIR` open/replay a persistent store and report WAL, metadata, segment, and locality health. `kouten verify --backup=DIR` verifies backup readability. `kouten doctor --data=DIR` / `--backup=DIR` use the same operational paths |
| Transaction | Done | Embedded atomic transaction plus all-or-nothing `batchPutAtomic`, `batchUpdateAtomic`, and `batchDeleteAtomic` helpers |
| Cooperative coordinate locks | Done | Embedded opt-in `ring` and `stellar` locks for high-integrity workflows; normal NoSQL read/write paths do not check locks |
| Cluster transaction landing | PoC | node0 landing. `scripts/cluster_tx_smoke.sh` covers apply smoke; `scripts/cluster_failure_smoke.sh` covers owner crash/restart retry; redundancy is not implemented yet |
| Cluster CRUD/list/count | PoC | `update`, `deleteById`, JSON `patch`, `listByRing`, `countByRing` use landing intents or node fan-out; `scripts/cluster_tx_smoke.sh` covers smoke |
| Compact | Done | Rebuilds WAL from live records |
| Backup / restore | Done | Backup as compacted WAL and restore into another data dir |
| Dump / import-jsonl | Done | NoSQL JSONL import rules. This is the stable human-readable migration boundary while the pre-v1.0 internal WAL format can still evolve |
| Universe sync outbox | PoC | WAL-backed eventual sync event queue with idempotent apply, ack/prune, transaction-backed `putSynced`, prune-safe monotonic source ids, latest-only pending coalescing, delayed timestamp apply windows, retryAt / maxAttempts / dead-letter state, `kouten universe-export` / `universe-apply` JSONL handoff, one-shot `kouten universe-sync` between local data dirs, remote `--peers` delivery via `UAPPLY`, and `universe-status` operational counters. It is a durable scheduler boundary, not immediate global consistency |
| Crash recovery tests | Partial | Torn WAL tail repair, versioned-WAL checksum mismatch refusal, mid-file WAL corruption refusal, compact interruption, partial commit cases |
| Strong durability / fsync knob | Done | `open(dataDir=..., durability=durStrong)` and `koutend --durability=strong`; store/API tests cover reopen, transaction, compact |
| Core test suite | Done | `scripts/test_core.sh` runs orbital core, selection, field, store, and public API tests |
| Full smoke suite | Done | `scripts/test_all_smoke.sh` runs core tests plus cluster tx, failure retry, authz, wire fuzz, recovery, and remote universe sync smoke; driver compatibility is opt-in |
| Generation snapshot / checkpoint | Planned | Generational snapshot and checkpoint are pending; encrypted backup is available |
| Kubernetes manifests | Planned | liveness/readiness, PVC, rolling restart |

## Cluster / Network

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Static cluster | Done | `koutend --id --peers` |
| Deterministic locate | Done | `E(id,t) -> node` |
| Handoff / forwarder | PoC | Slow tick integration exists. Fully distributed forwarder placement is not done |
| Driver-friendly wire | Done | `PUTR/GETID/QRYID`; `WIREVER` exposes the current protocol version and `CODECS` exposes payload formats. Compatibility policy is documented in `docs/protocol-compatibility.md` |
| Health / metrics / rings | Done | CLI and wire protocol; metrics include uptime, request/error/auth counters, connection counts, WAL bytes, warp backlog, universe apply counters, cluster tx backlog, and storage/ring counts |
| Authn + secret key | Done | username/password/secret-key; unusable credential combinations fail at startup |
| TLS | Done | Standard TLS transport for `koutend` and CLI/client connections when built with `-d:ssl`; `scripts/cluster_tls_smoke.sh` covers authenticated TLS, secret-key transport, JSON put/get, and plain-client rejection |
| Authz / RBAC | PoC | `koutend --allow-ring=prefix[,prefix...]` and `--role=user:password:reader|writer|admin[:prefixes]`; `scripts/cluster_authz_smoke.sh` and `scripts/cluster_rbac_smoke.sh` cover prefix and role matrix behavior |
| Wire fuzz smoke | Done | `scripts/cluster_wire_fuzz_smoke.sh` runs deterministic malformed-frame cases, including oversized headers and deep JSON, and verifies the cluster stays healthy |
| Server resource guardrails | Partial | Accepted sockets have a body-read timeout and fixed active-connection cap; fuller request-deadline and per-query cost controls remain planned |
| Embedded write guardrails | Foundation | Opt-in `KoutenGuardrails` can cap payload bytes, vector dimension, ring count, and records per ring for production trials; default zero values preserve existing behavior |
| Bounded server retrieve | Done | `koutend` keeps only the current top candidates up to request budget while scanning local vectors instead of retaining every matching payload before truncation |
| Dynamic membership / epoch migration | Foundation | Current peer list is still static at runtime, but v0.6 adds explicit arc tables, weighted arcs, deterministic virtual arcs, topology validation, and `remapFraction` so membership changes can be modeled with less unnecessary remapping than naive `mod nNodes`. Online rebalance workflow is still planned |
| Cluster transaction coordinator redundancy | Planned | Remove node0 as a single point of failure |
| Read-your-writes for cluster tx | PoC | `get/query/batchGet` fallback to node0 landing intent before owner apply; cluster smoke covers update/delete |
| Fault-tolerance improvements | Planned | Post-v0.1 work; universe sync outbox is now the first durable eventual-convergence primitive |
| Multi-VM / multi-AZ benchmark | Planned | Real-world latency and failure behavior |

## Managed Service Readiness Gaps

KoutenDB should be able to become a managed service in the same operational
category as hosted cache, document, search, or AI-context databases. Some
managed-service requirements are already expressible through KoutenDB concepts:
replication-style redundancy maps to universes, logical isolation maps to
galaxies, read scope maps to rings, and backup verification maps to recovery
universes.

The following items are the remaining implementation candidates that are not
fully covered by the current concepts or code:

| Candidate | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| Durable eventual universe sync | Universes currently cover recovery topology. A managed service also needs live delayed convergence between same-name galaxies across universes without global commit waits. |
| Ring apply policy | Managed deployments need per-ring behavior such as latest-only, append-only, bounded-history, and delayed timestamp apply. This keeps consistency rules explicit without making the whole DB strongly serializable. |
| Read-your-writes across local pending state | Local users should not feel universe-sync delay. The cluster landing-intent fallback is a start; universe-level pending overlays are still missing. |
| Dynamic node replacement | Managed services must replace failed or upgraded nodes without manual peer-list surgery. Current clusters use static peers. |
| Cluster coordinator redundancy | Node0 is currently the transaction landing zone. Managed service readiness needs the coordinator role to survive node replacement or failover. |
| TLS and certificate rotation | Username/password/secret-key auth exists, but managed public or VPC deployments need transport TLS and rotation workflows. |
| Secret rotation | `authProfiles` reference external secrets, but the server and drivers need an explicit rotation story for username/password/secret-key credentials. |
| Point-in-time recovery / generation checkpoints | Backup/restore exists. Managed services normally require recoverable generations, restore-point selection, and verification before promotion. |
| Drain / quiesce / snapshot barrier | Rolling maintenance and consistent managed backups need a control-plane hook to stop accepting new writes, flush durable state, and report readiness. |
| OpenMetrics / CloudWatch / Datadog adapters | KoutenDB exposes key/value metrics, but managed integrations need standard exporters or collectors. |
| Quotas and capacity guardrails | Galaxy isolation exists, but managed multi-tenant operation needs limits for WAL bytes, item count, ring count, payload size, and connection pressure. |
| Protocol / storage compatibility policy | Managed upgrades need clear compatibility rules for wire protocol, WAL records, snapshots, and drivers. |

These gaps define the boundary between a promising server database and a
provider-ready managed database. KoutenDB should not copy every Redis, RDS, or
ElastiCache mechanism one-to-one; it should provide equivalent operational
outcomes where KoutenDB's universe / galaxy / ring model already gives a simpler
or more natural shape.
